# NodeBasedQuestEditor

This repo contains a sample project for my node based quest system. It also contains the Unity asset package so other people may download and use this asset.

## What Does the Asset do?

This asset extends the Unity editor and provides a user interface for creating customizable, game state dependent quest lines. These quests also include dialogue conversations based on my [Node Based Dialogue System](https://github.com/mphilipp622/NodeBasedDialogueSystem)

## How to Download

If you want the entire project, you can just clone or download the repo. If you wish to download the unity package specifically, you can [download it here](https://github.com/mphilipp622/NodeBasedQuestEditor/blob/master/NodeBasedQuestSystem.unitypackage)
