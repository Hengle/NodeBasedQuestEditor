# NodeBasedQuestEditor

This repo contains a sample project for my node based quest system. It also contains the Unity asset package so other people may download and use this asset.

## What Does the Asset do?

This asset extends the Unity editor and provides a user interface for creating customizable, game state dependent quest lines. These quests also include dialogue conversations based on my [Node Based Dialogue System](https://github.com/mphilipp622/NodeBasedDialogueSystem)

## Requirements

This asset was developed in Unity 2018.2.2f1. Due to the way that Unity updated their package manager, it is recommended that you install at LEAST version 2018.2.2f1 [from here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=57864&os=Win)

This asset has not been tested on older versions and I cannot guarantee that it will work in those environments.

## How to Download

If you want the entire project, you can just clone or download the repo. If you wish to download the unity package specifically, you can [download it here](https://github.com/mphilipp622/NodeBasedQuestEditor/blob/master/NodeBasedQuestSystem.unitypackage)

## How to Use

It is recommended to download and read the [how to use pdf](https://github.com/mphilipp622/NodeBasedQuestEditor/blob/master/Assets/Node_Editor/HowToUseQuestEditor.pdf)

Video Tutorials will be posted soon.

Tutorials on the basics of the dialogue system [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCHmfbOH5iI&feature=youtu.be)

Additionally, you can watch [this video about working with speech bubbles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3Y4K0q5zoY&feature=youtu.be).

## Future Updates

The biggest priority update currently is to implement rewards. I developed this asset for my own game, which did not utilize a reward system for the quests. However, I understand that providing exp, items, currency, etc. is important for most quest systems. I hope that the system is easy enough to extend so users can create their own reward functionality until I am able to implement it. Do know that rewards are the highest priority update for this asset.

At the risk of sounding like I'm making excuses, I want it to be known that I am currently busy with a full-time job and the last semester for my BS degree in Computer Science. As such, I expect to be rather busy until 2019 and will likely not be able to commit lots of time to adding features and fixing bugs until then. Thanks!
